                    <h3>Jackson Galaxy</h3>
                    <h4>Now You're Talking My Langage: Communicating with Your Cat</h4>
                    Jackson Galaxy is a cat behaviorist and the host of the television show My Cat from Hell. Working
                    one-on-one with cats in their homes, he works with clients to improve their cats' behavioral issues.
                    Galaxy also works closely with animal shelters and rescue organizations, teaching his "Cat Mojo"
                    approach to feline behavior to volunteers, staff and adopters and helping with both behavioral and
                    environmental enrichment programs for their feline residents.

                    As our keynote speaker, Jackson Galaxy will talk to us about his "catification" process to help your
                    cat feel more comfortable in your home and how to communicate with your cat.
